Convert your X ðŸ§µ into a long form version that can be read as a blog.

Since the [X API is very expensive](https://developer.x.com/en/products/x-api), in order for you to convert the Thread into a blog, you will need to install the browser extension.

The website is made with NextJS and currently deployed on Vercel.

## Installing the browser extension

Only tested in Chrome.

For now, you will have to clone this repo, activate Chrome developer mode in the Extensions page and manually select the folder of the extension. I will soon upload it to the stores.
