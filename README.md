Convert your X ðŸ§µ into a long form version that can be read as a blog.

Since the [X API is very expensive](https://developer.x.com/en/products/x-api), in order for you to convert the Thread into a blog, you will need to install the browser extension.

TODO: we should inject a button in the X UI to directly open the Thread in a new page. The browser extension injects the button and, when clicked, reads the data and then redirects the user to the new page to read (new tab).

The website is made with NextJS and currently deployed on Vercel.

## Installing the browser extension
